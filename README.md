- kosminen: alkuräjähdyksestä nyky hetkeen

- historiallinen: nykyhetkestä historiaan 13 mrd vuotta


This file, log  aikajanat.html, is an HTML document that visualizes two timelines:

1. Kosminen aikajana (Cosmic Timeline, not implemented yet):  
   - Displays major events in the history of the universe, starting from the Big Bang (Alkuräjähdys) to the present.
   - Each event includes the number of years since the Big Bang, the equivalent in seconds, and the base-10 logarithm of the time interval.

2. Historiallinen aikajana (Historical Timeline, v22 used in index.html):  
   - Shows key moments in human and recent history, such as the invention of the internet, World Wars, and the emergence of Homo sapiens.
   - Each event lists how many years ago it happened, the equivalent seconds, and log₁₀(Δt).

Both tables are generated dynamically in the browser using JavaScript arrays of event objects. The tables are styled for readability, and all content is in Finnish. The page provides a visual sense of the vast scales of time, from fractions of a second after the Big Bang to recent human history.
